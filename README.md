## Introduction
The advent of foundation models and generative AI has transformed AI development, introducing complexities such as model selection, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, grounding outputs, and infrastructure optimization. This project focuses on MLOps practices tailored for generative AI, utilizing Vertex AI's comprehensive suite of tools to streamline these processes.

## What are MLOps and DevOps?
- **DevOps**: A methodology that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.
- **MLOps**: An extension of DevOps principles for machine learning, addressing data validation, model evaluation, monitoring, and reproducibility to manage the unique challenges of ML systems.

## Lifecycle of a Gen AI System
1. **Discovery**: Identify suitable foundation models based on quality, latency, cost, and compliance. Tools like Vertex Model Garden simplify this process by providing a curated collection of models.
2. **Development & Experimentation**: Involves prompt engineering, model chaining, and fine-tuning. Techniques like few-shot learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) are crucial.
3. **Deployment**: Manage artifacts like prompt templates, chain definitions, and embedding models. Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices ensure efficient deployment.
4. **Monitoring & Logging**: Continuous monitoring and evaluation are essential to detect model drift, performance issues, and ensure responsible AI practices.
5. **Governance**: Implement robust governance for data, models, and code, using Vertex AI's integrated tools for lineage tracking and compliance.

## Core Components of Vertex AI
1. **Vertex Model Garden**: A repository with over 150 models, including Google's proprietary models (e.g., PaLM 2, Gemini) and popular open-source models like BERT and Llama. Each model comes with a model card detailing use cases and deployment options.
2. **Vertex AI Studio**: An intuitive interface for model development, prompt testing, and fine-tuning, offering both console-driven and API-based workflows.
3. **Training & Tuning**: Utilize TPUs and GPUs for large-scale model training. Techniques like supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and model distillation are supported.
4. **Orchestration with Vertex Pipelines**: Automate and manage complex ML workflows, ensuring consistency and scalability.
5. **Grounding & Augmentation**: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to integrate real-time data into models, reducing hallucinations and enhancing output accuracy. Vertex AI also supports agent-based systems for complex query handling.
6. **Vector Search & Feature Store**: Manage embeddings and features for efficient data retrieval and search, using technologies like ScaNN for low-latency similarity search.
7. **Monitoring & Governance**: Implement logging, monitoring, and governance practices to ensure model performance, data integrity, and compliance.
