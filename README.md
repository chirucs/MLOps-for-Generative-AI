# Operationalizing Generative AI on Vertex AI

This repository contains key insights and practical resources from the whitepaper "Operationalizing Generative AI on Vertex AI using MLOps." It highlights essential practices and tools for deploying and managing generative AI systems using Google Cloud's Vertex AI.

## Overview
Generative AI systems bring new challenges like model selection, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and infrastructure optimization. This project focuses on how MLOps practices can be adapted for generative AI to streamline these processes on Vertex AI.

## Key Components
- **Vertex Model Garden**: A collection of over 150 pre-trained models for various tasks.
- **Vertex AI Studio**: An environment for prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and model deployment.
- **Training & Tuning**: Use of GPUs and TPUs for efficient model training and techniques like RLHF and model distillation.
- **Orchestration**: Automate workflows with Vertex Pipelines for consistent deployments.
- **Monitoring & Governance**: Tools for end-to-end logging, model performance monitoring, and data governance.

## Getting Started
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have a Google Cloud account and Vertex AI enabled.
2. **Clone the Repo**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chirucs/MLOps-for-Generative-AI.git
   ```
3. **Explore Notebooks**: Check out examples for prompt engineering and model tuning.
